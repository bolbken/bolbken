### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Ben.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on real-time backend web services using `Typescript`, `Python`, `Golang`, and `CockroachDB`

- 🌱 I’m hoping to master `Golang` someday...

- ❤️ I really like working with time-series data streams, building *rad* backend services and asking *dumb* questions.
